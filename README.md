# Resources related to peer code review
## Building off peer code review unconference and hackathon at [Society for Open, Reliable, and Transparent Ecology and Evolutionary Biology conference](https://www.sortee.org/) conference July, 2021 

We have adopted a roving curator model, where a different volunteer organises the meetup the first Wednesday of each month. They will be responsible for setting the time of the meetup (shared in UTC please!), sending the meeting link, and electing if they will be showing code or leading discussion of a topic. For code review sessions, we want to continue adding them as [issues](https://github.com/SORTEE/peer-code-review-resources/issues) in this repo. How to do that, you ask?

1. make a github acct if you do not have one
2. comment in the slack channel to be "invited" to the SORTEE github group and peer review club team
3. click on the "issues" tab
4. then click on the green button "new issue"
5. name the code review, and fill in the requested information, namely your username, the repo, and your aims :nerd_face:

## Notes on contributing to the website

The website builds with a github action, so to make changes you only need to submit a pull request with those changes, and the quarto website will rebuild automatically.
