# Workshop materials: Developing a model for peer code review
## SORTEE conference July, 2021

Repository for materials for the unconference and hackathan on peer code review at the [Society for Open, Reliable, and Transparent Ecology and Evolutionary Biology conference](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/sortee-conference-2021-registration-154693776249)

## Unconference
Day 3 Wednesday 14/7/21 between 03:30 UTC and 04:30 UTC

Outline: We will prompt discussion with the following main questions: Why should we care about peer code review? What should one look for when reviewing code? How can we get started with peer code review? We will then follow this discussion with a Hackathon (H10) to develop a rubric for peer code review.

## Hackathon
Day 3 Wednesday 14/7/21 between 04:30 UTC and 05:30 UTC

Outline: Our aim is to come up with a rubric for peer code review and guidelines for using the rubric, and to brainstorm how these ideas could be expanded more formally similar to the way software code is reviewed by ROpenSci. Depending on the number of attendees, we will break up into small groups to ensure everyone has the opportunity to contribute. This hackathon follows Unconference 07, but attendence of the unconference session is NOT required for later attendance of this hackathon.
