During annual meetings in 2021 and 2022, we ran discussion groups about peer code review and its role in the scientific workflow. The outcome of these discussions was a peer code review club, that you can learn more about on GitHub, and a research paper:\n\nIvimey-Cook, E. R.*, Pick, J. L., Bairos-Novak, K.
